        Lord, I thank you that I don&apos;t have to be anxious about anything. I
        thank you that I can lay every burden and every care at your feet.
        Instead of trying to fix my problems on my own, I thank you that I can
        give them to you. Thank you Lord that when I give you my anxiety and my
        worries, you give me your peace. Even when things may be going wrong,
        internally I can have peace. And Lord, help me to do this. Help me to
        lay these anxieties at your feet. Help me to give them to you even when
        I&apos;d much rather hang on to them. Help me to trust you to do what
        only you can do instead of trying to do what I cannot do. Thank you
        Lord. Amen.

        Psalms where the Psalmist cries out to God in pain. These are Psalms of
        Lament. Psalm 10 is one of these. The heart-felt emotion comes from deep
        pain of a man, even a king, living in a troubled world. The Psalmists
        were real people just like us, crying out to God about the pain of
        everyday life.

          fluent in the dialect of lament. Just as you use other prayer
          dialects&mdash;adoration, thanksgiving, confession, and so
          on&mdash;lament is a biblical and needed form of prayer. It is pouring
          out your complaint to God.
