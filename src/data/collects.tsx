        Almighty God our Savior,

        you desire that none should perish,

        and you have taught us through your Son
        <br />
        that there is great joy in heaven

        <br />
        Grant that our hearts may ache for a lost and broken world.

        May your Holy Spirit work through our words, deeds, and prayers,
        <br />
        that the lost may be found and the dead made alive,
        <br />
        and that all your redeemed may rejoice around your throne; <br />
        through Jesus Christ our Lord. <span className="font-bold">Amen.</span>

        Let us pray for the holy Church throughout the world: that the Lord our

        subjection all powers and principalities; and that he may grant us to
        dwell in such peace and tranquility that we may show forth the glory of
        God. Silence Almighty Father, we pray for your holy catholic Church.
        Fill it with all truth, in all truth, with all peace. Where it is
        corrupt, purify it; where it is in error, direct it; where in anything
        it is amiss, reform it; where it is right, strengthen it; where it is in
        want, provide for it; where it is divided, reunite it; for the sake of
        Jesus Christ your Son our Savior.{' '}
