        you have filled the world with beauty:

        Open our eyes to behold your gracious hand in all your works;

        your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. <span className="font-bold">Amen.</span>

        Almighty God our Savior,
        <br />
        you desire that none should perish,
        <br />
        and you have taught us through your Son
        <br />
        that there is great joy in heaven

        over every sinner who repents:
        <br />
        Grant that our hearts may ache for a lost and broken world.
        <br />
        May your Holy Spirit work through our words, deeds, and prayers,
        <br />
        that the lost may be found and the dead made alive,
        <br />
        and that all your redeemed may rejoice around your throne; <br />
        through Jesus Christ our Lord. <span className="font-bold">Amen.</span>

        Everlasting God,

        in whom we live and move and have our being:

        You have made us for yourself,

        so that our hearts are restless

        Give us purity of heart and strength of purpose,

        that no selfish passion may hinder us from knowing your will,
        <br />
        no weakness keep us from doing it;

        and in your service find perfect freedom;
