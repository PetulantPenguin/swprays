Instead of trying to fix my problems on my own, I thank you that I can give them to you. Thank you Lord that when I give you my anxiety and my worries, you give me your peace. Even when things may be going wrong, internally I can have peace. And Lord, help me to do this. Help me to lay these anxieties at your feet. Help me to give them to you even when I’d much rather hang on to them. Help me to trust you to do what only you can do instead of trying to do what I cannot do. Thank you Lord. Amen.`,
